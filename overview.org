* Economics
** Building manager
*** Stochastic
*** Deterministic
**** Wrappers for each Building, to ensure load balancing
** Population Manager
** Controls the worker assignments
* Military Manager
** Unit Management
*** Micromanagement functions
** Ratios of unit usefulness, inserting units into queue
* Information Manager
** Informs the Military manager of the units we see, and this informs the ratios of unit usefulness
** Resources Manager
*** Keeps track of rates, derivatives
** Map information


* Things we want
** Priority should be able to be read as a function
*** At first, we probably just want the function to return the number we put in, but at later points, we'll likely put in say, time dependent functions
** Possibly a function to determine number of workers to build a building?
** Priority queue of units, which we go through each tick, and make sure they are building/going to be built
** We are going to need to figure out how to place buildings, and have some logic for how to place buildings, how to place resource collection points for maximal efficiency
** Assign how many to build based on priority of workers at current, priority of that building.
** Info Manager
*** Derivatives
*** Enemy Unit estimates = Enemy units last seen + military buildings * rate of units
*** What Civilization we are, they are
*** Where we know their buildings are, our buildings are
*** Where possibly resources are
*** Find Place to build buildings
*** Get Map
*** Get time elapsed
*** Percentages of each unit
** Military Manager
